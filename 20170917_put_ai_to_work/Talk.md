Title: MyShake - Analyze data from a global smartphone seismic network

**Description** (brief overview for marketing purposes, max. length 400 charactersâ€”about 65 words)

Dealing with large-scale sensor arrays? MyShake is a project to show you how we applied AI to distinguish earthquakes from consumer smartphones and build the whole system to collect and analyze sensor data globally. 

**Abstract**    
MyShake is a global smartphone seismic network that harnesses the power of crowdsourcing. It has two component: an android application running on the personal smartphones monitoring the sensors inside to detect earthquake-like motion, and a network detection algorithm to aggregate results from multiple smartphones to detect earthquakes. The MyShake application was released to the public on Feb 12th 2016. Within the first year, there are more than 250,000 earthquakes recorded by the smartphones all over the world, including events in Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Morocco, Greece, Nepal, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan, and across North America. In this presentation, I will show the artificial neural network approach we used to distinguish the earthquakes from daily human activities and the whole infrastructure of the whole system. Currently, we are collecting 30 GB time-series data each day, I will also show how do we extract earthquake signal from the data. 

**What's the takeaway for the audience?**   
Main ideas and/or skills attendees will learn from your presentation

This presentation will be a show case of how we apply AI and implement it to solve an interesting problem in reducing the earthquake hazards. The audience will learn how we started the project and built the whole system to dealing large scale sensor data. I also hope this case could raise discussions about the algorithm and the infrastructure.
