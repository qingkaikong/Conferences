Introduction to Artificial Neural Network

Deep learning is popular. But a good understanding of the basics of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will help a lot to learn deep learning. This tutorial session will cover the basics of artificial neural network, it will let you understand the key concepts while implementing a simple ANN step by step. 


This workshop introduces Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a popular machine learning algorithm. No prior knowledge is required, though previous experience with other machine learning algorithms would be helpful. The workshop will be divided into 4 parts:

(1) A brief history of ANNs and an explanation of the intuition behind them. This part aims to give the audience a conceptual understanding with few mathematical barriers, and no programming requirements.
(2) In this part, the core concept of ANN will be introduced, including forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent and so on. I will also walk through a step-by-step construction of Perceptron and Multilayer Perceptron using basic Python. This part aims to give the audience the deeper understanding of ANN core concepts, and what's inside the black box. 
(3) Using the popular Python library scikit-learn, we will work out a real world example by recognizing handwritten digits. High-level libraries reduce the work for a researcher implementing ANN down to tuning a set of parameters, which will be explained in this part.
(4) A gentle touch of basic deep learning will conclude this workshop to motivate the audience to learn more.


PhD student at UC Berkeley in Seismology, Qingkai has 5 years Machine learning experience with 3 years Python experience. Qingkai is working on a project to build a smartphone seismic network by turning everyone's smartphone into a seismometer. In this project he applies the Artificial Neural Network to classify earthquake motion from the human activities and achieved reasonable results.

Attendees will have a clear idea of how the popular artificial neural network works. They will understand the key concepts and how do they work, i.e. backpropagation, learning rate, momentum, etc. This will help them to apply the algorithm in their work and learn deep learning better. 


No prior knowledge is required, though previous experience with other machine learning algorithms would be helpful. Also, basic programming skills will help as well. 

A laptop that can run Jupiter notebook will be ideal. But I am trying to use the mybinder to run all the notebooks (you can also install the basic Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn packages), to launch it, click the 'launch binder' badge on https://github.com/qingkaikong/20161202_ANN_basics

Qingkai is on his 6th year PhD journey at Berkeley Seismological Lab. He has 5 years Machine learning experience with 3 years Python experience. Qingkai is working on a project to build a smartphone seismic network by turning everyone's smartphone into a seismometer. In this project he applies the Artificial Neural Network to classify earthquake motion from the human activities and achieved reasonable results. This tutorial is developed by Qingkai for Berkeley D-Lab workshop, and he have already given this workshop twice and will give teach this workshop at D-Lab again this April (http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/introduction-artificial-neural-networks-0). The proposed tutorial will be largely similar to what I have already given by adding some new things.
