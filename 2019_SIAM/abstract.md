## MyShake - Dense Global Seismic Network Using Smartphones

Sensors play an important role in today's world to sense the environment, but what's the best way to scale the density of sensors up to have finer spatial recordings? MyShake is a project exploring along this line by turning the daily smartphones in your pocket to a recording device to monitor the earthquakes. With this approach, a dense global seismic network has been set up in recently, and started to detect earthquakes and potentially issue earthquake early warning in the near future. The higher density of this low-cost sensor network comes with a price of noisier data compare with the high-quality sensors, for example, the phones are moving around, the noise level on the phones are high, there are so many human activities in the data and so on. Therefore, special treatment is needed to address these issues. In this talk, I will take you on the journey of addressing them using machine learning approaches, such as Artificial Neural Network, clustering algorithms and so on. At the same time, data collected and observations from this network will be reported here to illustrate the effectiveness of this low-cost smartphone network.
